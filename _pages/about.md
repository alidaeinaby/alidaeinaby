I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Operations Management and Statistics at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, advised by Ming Hu. I am interested in the role of uncertainty in markets from both the supply and demand perspectives. In particular, I study the effect of buyers' uncertainty in mechanism design and limited price experimentation in revenue management. Before Rotman, I achieved a master's degree in Applied Mathematics and a bachelor's in Mathematics and Applications from Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
